							<h1>About Me</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/Management Engineering Class of 2024 Pic.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Thanks for taking the time to check out my website! This section is really just about me, my interests, and photos of some fun experiences I've had in the past :)</p>
							<p>Well, where to start? As you may know, I currently attend the University of Waterloo, studying Management Engineering (picture above is my cohort who have all endured blood, sweat, and tears in the past few years). I hope to one day go into the data analytics field since data provides so much valuable insights for businesses and makes a big impact in business decisions. I've had many co-op experiences, which range from the transportation industry to banking. Most of my roles have been providing business insights through data in the form of dashboards, which were created through Tableau and Power BI. I love seeing how thousands of rows of data get converted into beautiful visualizations that leaders can quickly digest and understand their business. If you want to know more about my experiences, please refer to my resume.</p>
							<p>On a personal note, I really love is travelling and hiking to explore new places. I have some pictures below of places I've gone and things I've done that taught me a lot and are some of my most treasured memories.</p>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Hudong AID summer.jpg" alt="" /></span>I volunteered as a Student English Teacher back in 2018 to teach elementary school students English for 2 weeks in Taiwan. This really threw me into the deep end as I had to learn to quickly become a team with other Student Teachers who I've never met before, I needed to learn how to communicate to the kids I was teaching, and I needed to learn different ways of teaching. I also had to learn how to take care of myself in a city I've never been to before. I learned a lot about myself through this experience, and will forever be grateful for the memories and friendships formed with the students, other teachers, and mentors.</p>
							<p><br><span class="image right"><img src="images/DECA printed pic.jpg" alt="" /></span>I was part of a business club called DECA in high school. This is where I was really introduced to the business world and how it works. Through presentations and case studies, I was able to win awards at Regionals, Provincials, and even got the opportunity to attend the international competition (ICDC) twice! I was also part of my school's executive team for DECA, which gave me the opportunity to lead students on the best ways to approach competitions. This is the first experience where I built up confidence in public speaking and got the opportunity to experience a leadership role.</p>
							<p> Annnnd then there was the beginning of university. That was definetly a rough transition, I often wondered if I was good enough to be in the program, let alone the university. Keeping up with assignments and studying for exams was difficult, but after trial and error, I finally figured out how to organize my time effectively (Google calendar is the best!) all while maintaining a decent social life. The constant change brought on by co-op terms was a shock to me at first, but as the years passed, I realized change is a constant no matter what stage of life you're in. Once that sunk in, I found myself more easily accepting change and adapting to it.</p>
							<p><br><span class="image left"><img src="images/Saint John waterfall.jpg" alt="" /></span>For one of my co-op terms, I went to Saint John, New Brunswick (not St. John's, Newfoundland!). I had never been to the East coast of Canada before, so I was once again going to be alone in a new place, but this time for 4 months! However, I was quite excited to explore and make new friends so that's what I did. I went all around Saint John, from finding a hidden waterfall (pictured on the left) to late night carnival festivities, I made sure to do it all! Also, got so many steps in during these four months :)  I learned I really loved hiking here, since the whole journey is exciting, you never know what you're going to find! </p>
